An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).

used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).

can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.

browser interprets them & renders correct character.
